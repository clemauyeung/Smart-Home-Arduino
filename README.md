# Prototyping a Smart Home Concept with Arduino

For a physical prototyping class for HCDE, I was tasked with creating a smart home concept. I joined 3 other students to replicate the Clue board game house. Each member worked individually on a room of their choice, using switches, sensors, lights, and motors to respond to disasters (e.g. fires, burglary, earthquake, zombie attacks, etc.) as well as other features specific to the room.

## My Prototype

I created a smart library where you can share your favorite book collection with the world in real-time and be safe from disasters while reading them.

For discerning readers who wants to pamper their inner introvert with a night in, they can still interact with people’s digital bookshelves rather than people themselves. When readers place their favorite books in a specific area of the bookshelf, it will automatically upload the book’s title and author to readers’ online “Recommended books” list in real-time. Instead of “Keeping up with the Joneses,” people could keep up with others’ intellectual prowess and interests, which is a more conducive conversation starter for introverts who rather expend their energy on meaningful conversations. 

## Features

The updated version of the library now includes:

* A secret reading room people can access via a hidden button and is zombie-proof
* An earthquake alarm system to warm readers who are too absorbed into their book
* An alert system that let other players know when specific characters enter the room
